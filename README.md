# Minimax

## background and motivation:

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles. The Minimax algorithm is a simulation of Nim that generates the most optimal move (choosing from 1-3 objects from the pile) for the player. Using recusion, the program is able to generate all possible outcomes for the player, therefore, it is sure to predict the most optimal path to take in order to win the game. 
Nim is a very good test for this algorthm as there are many possible outcomes based on how many object a player takes, therefore, many places for the recusive function to run. (ask about**)

## usage:
??

## future directions:
If I were to make updates to this code, I would probably add the feature to add how many piles are available to pick from in the game. That would mean there would be a limit on how many a player could take during a certain turn as they cannot take from multiple piles.
